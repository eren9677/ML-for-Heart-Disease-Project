# Using Machine Learning for Disease Diagnosis

## Introduction
This project explores using machine learning (ML) models (SVC & XGBoost performed best) to analyze patient data (history, symptoms, labs) for faster and more accurate heart disease diagnosis. (evaluated 7 models using ROC-AUC & cross-validation).

## Project Goals
CHD is a major cause of death worldwide, including Turkey. This project proposed that
XGB model enhanced with PCA combined feature set is useful to diagnose the
presence of CHD and help patients get the treatment immediately to longer their
lifespan. Moreover, implementation of machine learning in health care is needed
especially considering the human made errors and advances in medical technology
